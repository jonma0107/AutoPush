I can't directly create a file and return it as code. Files are stored on a file system, and I can't represent that directly as text output.

However, I can provide you with a simple command (for a Unix-like system) that you can use to create an empty text file named "my_empty_file.txt":

```bash
touch my_empty_file.txt
```

If you're on a different operating system, the command might be slightly different, but the core concept remains the same. You would use a command-line instruction to create an empty file.
